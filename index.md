---
- I am a Senior Researcher at [Cerebras Systems](https://cerebras.ai), as part of their Advanced Technology Group.
- My main research interests are deep learning, high performance computing, hardware-software co-design, and numerical linear algebra.
- Prior to Cerebras, I completed my PhD at Stanford in Computational and Mathematical Engineering.
- Prior to Stanford, I worked at Microsoft for two years as a software engineer, doing full-stack development for an internal-facing product to interface with and leverage the Microsoft customer knowledge graph.
- Outside of my research, I am an avid hiker, runner, and triathlete.
