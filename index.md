---
- I am a 3rd year student at [Stanford's Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering](https://icme.stanford.edu/) working in the lab of Professor [Eric Darve](https://me.stanford.edu/people/eric-darve).
- My main research interests are numerical linear algebra, high performance computing, and human-augmenting AI.
- Prior to Stanford, I worked at Microsoft for two years as a software engineer, doing full-stack development for an internal-facing product to interface with and leverage the Microsoft customer knowledge graph.
- Outside of my research, I am an active member of [Stanford's Club Triathlon Team](https://www.stanfordtriathlon.com/) and currently serve as its Vice President.
