- I finished my PhD in Computational and Mathematical Engineering at Stanford University in June 2023. My advisor was Professor Eric Darve.
- I received my BS from Yale in 2016, double majoring in Applied Mathematics and Mechanical Engineering.

- I currently work at [Cerebras Systems](https://www.cerebras.ai/), as part of their Advanced Technology Group. Some projects I have worked on include:
    - Extremely long context attention (10M+ tokens) for real-time processing of huge (1B+ scalar) inputs
    - Game-playing reinforcement learning pipeline, running on 16x Cerebras’ WSE-2 hardware (~30 petaFLOPs of compute) with 128 supporting CPUs
    - Training massive (up to 2T params) transformer models for natural language processing (NLP) tasks on Cerebras’ WSE-2 hardware, using high (up to 100x) parameter sparsity and reversible computations to extract maximum performance
- During the summer of 2021, I interned at [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/) as a deep learning research intern on the AV Perception team, investigating neural network pruning to speedup inference for image classification and object detection tasks.
- During the summer of 2020, I interned at the [SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory](https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/), working on anomaly detection algorithms to detect failures in the [LCLS](https://lcls.slac.stanford.edu/) beam.
- From 2016-2018, I was a full-time software engineer at Microsoft at their headquarters in Redmond, WA.
- During undergrad, I also interned at [SIG](https://sig.com/), [GE Digital](https://www.ge.com/digital/) (formerly GE Intelligent Platforms), and [CERN](https://home.cern/)'s ATLAS detector.

- I have at time or another coded in: C, C++, C#, Java, Fortran77, Python 2 & 3, Julia, CUDA, Javascript/Typescript, R, PHP, SQL, MATLAB, and several Cerebras-specific languages. I (perhaps optimistically) believe that I can pick any of these back up and hit the ground running.
