## Triathlon
I am an avid member of the Stanford University Club Triathlon Team. I compete regularly in the West Coast Collegiate Triathlon Conference and annually at the USA Triathlon Collegiate Club nationals. Coming from a pure running background, I have learned a lot over the past several years on the team. Ultimately I have my sights set on full-length Ironman triathlons and a bid to race at Kona.

If it's your cup of tea, you can follow me on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/31148058).

## Traveling
With the free time I have left, I try to travel as much as possible, mainly to either backpack or scuba dive. Most recently I spent two weeks in Aspen, Colorado in July 2020.

The highlight trip of the last several years was three weeks in the Patagonia region of Chile and Argentina in December 2018.
