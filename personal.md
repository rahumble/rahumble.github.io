## Triathlon
During my time at Stanford, I was an avid member of the Stanford University Club Triathlon Team. I competed regularly in the West Coast Collegiate Triathlon Conference and annually at the USA Triathlon Collegiate Club nationals. Coming from a pure running background, I learned a lot during my years on the team. Some day I hope to complete a full-length Ironman triathlons and qualify to race at Kona.

If it's your cup of tea, you can follow me on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/31148058).

## Traveling
With the free time I have left, I try to travel as much as possible, mainly to either backpack or scuba dive. Most recently I hiked the John Muir Trail in August 2023.

Prior to that, I climbed Mount Rainier in July 2021.

I also spent several weeks in Aspen, Coloroado during summer 2020.

The highlight trip of the last several years was three weeks in the Patagonia region of Chile and Argentina in December 2018.
